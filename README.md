1. Create and activate a virtual environment:
    
    - For Windows, run these commands in the terminal::
        python -m venv venv
        venv\Scripts\Activate
    
    - For Mac/Linux run these commands in the terminal:
        python3 -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate
    
2. Install dependencies:
